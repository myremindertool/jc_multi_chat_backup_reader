17/11/2023, 10:01 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Dear all,

Plz note when you are hiring staff who hold visit visa inform 
them that they will be under 3 months probation and their visa will be processed only after their successful probation period. We can take their temporary work permit and can process their normal visa after probation period.

Taking their visa and cancelling their visa‚Äôs coz their poor performance is strictly not allowed. We are investing money on each employee. It is equally HR‚Äôs duty to make sure you are evaluating employee‚Äôs performance before processing their visa.

Also without completing their documentation for MOE/ KHDA approval you cannot proceed their documents for visa.

Make sure you recruit the right candidate. Under any pressure so not hire anybody without a proper documents. Be very strict on this.

Staff who hold visit visa can be treated as temporary staff and can be removed their name from biometric and timetable for inspection requirements.

Thank you.

We can process their visa / labour card if they have teacher approval 

Ajman HR‚Äôs can submit their qualification certificate and can apply for NOC with their professional designation then can apply for work permit / school visa

Dubai teachers if they already hav teacher approval and qualificatio  we can hire them. But before the joining they shd visit Labour office with rheir certificates and they will issue a letter after they verify the certificates. With this we can process their visa/ labour card

Avoid hiring pakistani staff without approval / proper educational certificates. If they hav approval of teacher we will get visa. 

As of now they hav blocked entite system for pakistani nationalities but PRO is saying they will open after a week mostly. That time with KHDA/ MOE approval we can apply

A new rule has amended about work visa processing.
We need to make sure we have a mixed population of workers who are working under us in school visa. 
If the percentage is going up for any specific country holders then thr will be rejections. 
So kindly do not target only specific country ppl. If u r hiring then plz note they are under spouse sponsorship.
Basically you need to maintain a percentage.

29/01/2024, 13:34 - Aysha Rasbin: @971564118122 The penalty amount if an employee resigns before 1 year is mentioned in the labor contract as *training cost*. If the employee contacts MOHRE, they ask the school to submit evidence. So isn't it safe for us to rename the term 'training' to something common that is applicable without conflict?
29/01/2024, 13:37 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: As per the MOL rule training cost is a safe word. As per the policy we can take training cost from the emoloyees if they terminate the contract before 1 year
29/01/2024, 13:39 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: If they ask for evidence too you can show them the contract
29/01/2024, 13:42 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: You need to keep the record about training but. Take induction feedback form ( shared before ), keep pictures of training, even we r giving erp traning.

Just now , I forwarded an email from a typist regarding visa renewal. Our current insurance has no provision to link with ICP in case of visa renewal. Last month, we also faced the same concern, so we opted for outside insurance.
21/03/2024, 14:24 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: I had a discussion on this. We will continue with sagar only . During next renewal we will  change it. Those who need new  insurance for visa renewal we will ask pro ro take an individual insurance and ask sajid for reimbursement against thst particilar person‚Äôs insurance amount on pro rata basis. Cancelling full insurance is not possible now. So we will plan this way now

10/05/2024, 08:44 - Dush: Dear Team, we are meeting multiple vendors for better insurance at the moment. As we are school entity, we have limited options from insurer. Hope fully we will be closing same at the earlesit.
10/05/2024, 08:45 - Dush: Dear Team- Have recieved ILOE status only from Rasha. Others ,Kindly do share the same.
10/05/2024, 08:49 - Aysha Rasbin: @971509027945 also the major forms like misspunch, early exit, probation, exit clearance etc. HR guidelines, dress policy

10/05/2024, 08:51 - Reenu Personal: Is the principal the signing authority
10/05/2024, 10:05 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: No
10/05/2024, 10:05 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Me or Mr Asmal as of now
10/05/2024, 11:19 - Dush: Hi Team, Hope all have received current month salary. Please make list of observations or areas of improvement in current month salary payout. we will have meeting in the next on same. Ther are some last minute deduction such Visa , ILOE has come which was informed to employee in advance.
10/05/2024, 12:18 - Reshmi: we havent received any email for deductions
10/05/2024, 12:18 - Dush: ok
10/05/2024, 12:26 - Reshmi: Dear Dush..I've a concern regarding preparing this document.. firstly the responsibility of getting the Job loss insurance done is not the HR officers/ Schools responsibility.. If the staff is not willing to do the same..even after reminders are sent..its they who are at fault.. the best possibility of getting this report done..is only send the google sheet to all staff and ask them to fill..
10/05/2024, 12:26 - Reshmi: if its ok to do with the google sheet..i will circulate
10/05/2024, 12:26 - Reshmi: This is a time consuming work, in between our busy schedules
10/05/2024, 12:43 - Dush: see the reason, we are pushing ILOE insurance to avoid deduction in salary and if employee exiting we dont know wether he has ILOE fine unless account/pro tell us. If we are not aware same will not be deducted in F&F and we would loosing same.
10/05/2024, 12:44 - Reenu Personal: While sending the labor/visa cancelation we mentioned in the email like please update regarding ILOE fine such that  we can deduct in settlement and vice versa they are updating us via email
10/05/2024, 12:44 - Aysha Rasbin: While preparing settlement, we check with pro for deductions and confirm prior
10/05/2024, 12:44 - Reenu Personal: We haven't incurred this
10/05/2024, 12:44 - Reenu Personal: Correct
10/05/2024, 12:46 - Reenu Personal: <Media omitted>
10/05/2024, 12:46 - Reenu Personal: Like this, we sent the email for the cancelation
10/05/2024, 12:46 - Reenu Personal: So we have everything in email only
10/05/2024, 12:47 - Reenu Personal: For future reference
10/05/2024, 12:49 - Aysha Rasbin: Ys a Google form or sheet will be easy.

But this frequent followup from school side gives employees an image that it is something related to our school process. Instead we have to stress that it's employee responsibility.
I think we should just assist with process only if they have any doubts. If we can upload manual in ess, that's also done
10/05/2024, 12:50 - Dush: see currently, as and when there is fine, PRO he is paying the fine and later deducting from employee. Why should we be paying fine on behalf of employee fine when it is employee  responsibility to pay the same. we are responsible only for salary not for the fine. there are chances that, sometime miss to deduct from F&F as well.
10/05/2024, 12:51 - Aysha Rasbin: If fine is not paid, we can't cancel the work permit or visa later
10/05/2024, 12:55 - Dush: yes. exactly. why we should pay the fine. this money supposed to be for processing visa and other things. not to pay the fine. Please educate staffs on same. if there is challenge please drive it with thier reporting managers. If you need more time for report , please take time till 15th May.
10/05/2024, 12:57 - Dush: it looks like in a way we are giving advance to employee to pay the fine. which is not correct. After 1 month  things will be smoother.
10/05/2024, 12:57 - Reenu Personal: We are educating them
10/05/2024, 12:57 - Reenu Personal: Monthly reminders
10/05/2024, 13:02 - Dush: disinterest or negligence to subscribe is not valid excuse for employee. when it is mandatory from their part. Please make them informed and Mandate while releasing offer that they must opt for ILOE within 45 days from the date of work permit issued.
10/05/2024, 13:03 - Dush: Please share report by 16th May. No probs.
10/05/2024, 13:14 - Dush: This message was deleted

2. Approvals completed 
3. Summer holidays resignations will be considered a breach in notice period

19/08/2024, 09:23 - Vandana: As per PRO, its okay to put in offer letter. But not in contract. That is why.
19/08/2024, 09:24 - Vandana: & notice period is supposed to be 'in serving' & not summer vacation
19/08/2024, 09:25 - Vandana: Point 2 can be put for all because anyways they are getting KHDA before only.

19/08/2024, 09:42 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Then it should be discussed before school closed for summer holidays. Now during this peak time i cannot spend time on that. So plz add these points and discuss with GM if he approves we can go ahead

20/08/2024, 21:42 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Without completing payroll how we will plan early disbursal.. I would recommend if all can start the work now with working days calculation later they can do one or two changes if anyone is on leave then <This message was edited>

21/08/2024, 11:43 - Vandana: Since we have to compile 3 data files - Jul working, Aug working + Aug leave, please start working on them separately from your end.

@‚Å®Poornima Woodlem‚Å© 
Can we place a cut off on 25 Aug ? 
This will be helpful this month. 
Next month onwards we'll get back to normal cut off as last day of the month
21/08/2024, 11:45 - Reenu Personal: I had shared with reshmi
21/08/2024, 12:19 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: No. We already hav less number of working days to calculate . So wat is the point to keep 25th as cut off
21/08/2024, 12:19 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Dear All,

I have shared the salary format via email 
Plz check
21/08/2024, 12:48 - Vandana: One single file has to have 3 sets of data. For Jurf, Ghusais & Hamidiya - more strength to verify.
21/08/2024, 12:57 - Vandana: I tried your format but for Aug I am not finding it user friendly. Mistakes are bound to happen as it happened in July working days file. Few names were missed totally.
21/08/2024, 13:11 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Kindly share your own formats with the HR‚Äôs . Make sure we can plan the disbursal little early.
21/08/2024, 13:13 - Vandana: That is why 25 cut off
21/08/2024, 13:14 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: No need. I am talking about salary release on 5th or 6th . For that 25th cut off is not required
21/08/2024, 18:22 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
21/08/2024, 18:33 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Indeed‚Ä¶others plz plan something like this after our hectic reopening days ‚ù§Ô∏è

25/08/2024, 13:47 - Reshmi: is there any possibilty for Riyas to do the net salary if we give the attendance
25/08/2024, 13:47 - Reshmi: its very confusing and difficult
25/08/2024, 13:54 - HR British: Yes please
25/08/2024, 14:17 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Wat is the confusion thr. U can count the total working days for both the month..take the total ..as we hav 31 days for both july and aug divide the total working days with 31 ..then u get the net
25/08/2024, 16:10 - Vandana: In one situation like this, please clarify what to calculate 
1. Admin staff 15 days from 45 days is due for Aug pay
2. Full attendance in Ghusais 17 days
15+17 = 32 days salary ?

If we don't give 15 days then it is 30 days paid leave only

If we give then it's 32

If we look into 'working days' then it's 17 not 15 because they open on 15th 

It is confusing üòï
25/08/2024, 16:13 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Will send a detailed mail on this tomrw

There is an additional step in 'Passport verification' which is to check their 'visit visa' status. In general, staff on visit visas whose residence visa applications might get rejected. This incident happened today when Salim was submitting applications.  

Please ensure your new recruits are not having visit visas. If they have, then please discuss it with Poornima. <This message was edited>

30/08/2024, 13:55 - Aysha Rasbin: We have staff on visit visas.

04/09/2024, 04:39 - Vandana: Good morning Officers 
Please do this one list preparation 
Pending 
1. Work Permit 
2. School Visa
3. Renewals of the above 2 in the next 1 month
If this list is not submitted by 10 am today, our HR department may be facing some challenges from management. 

One thing to understand here is that when you say 100 work permits pending, you should have the documents ready for those 100 staff. 
 üíØ full sets of documents. Not some MOFA missing, attestation missing, clear copies missing, specified photo missing. 
Make Google form & send to your staff for ALL documents submission & give them a deadline. 

This is being done as a development step otherwise we'll be just calling here & there with insufficient results. 

Other departments are linked & I understand how the system works. HR will be blamed for 
Money related 
Documents related 
All other blames might be there....

I want to keep my team safe & sound & I cannot do it alone.

Take necessary steps, approvals, discussions & get your work done.

I'm arranging one person for PRO follow ups from tomorrow. 
1. Only emails to Salim & Sinan
2. Follow up with calls & emails to new person. 
3. If the above 2 not responding, escalate to me in email, WhatsApp, calls immediately. 
Please take your HR role in a more competitive way from now on....

This is sent on WhatsApp for a reason. We're all together going to make it a dream team ‚ú®Ô∏è 

My heartiest appreciation & wishes to each one of you. Be your own master that everyone follows. Learn the smart way & avoid unwanted stuff.

This is to inform you about the duty allocation for admin staff during the morning reception of students. 
It is essential that admin personnel are strategically stationed in the OT area /transport area and Reception to ensure a warm and welcoming atmosphere for arriving students. Admin Managers and HR are expected to take the initiative in organizing this arrangement and to communicate it effectively to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) for their involvement. Additionally, please ensure that PE teachers are assigned to key areas such as corridors to serve as disciplinary supervisors.                                                                                                                                              All facility staff under your supervision must be in proper uniform and display their school ID cards at all times. Kindly ensure that these responsibilities are managed diligently to uphold the standards expected.

21/10/2024, 08:33 - Vandana: An interesting read for us in HR                                                        What is the role of HR in the business landscape?
In this modern business landscape, Human Resources (HR) emerges as a multifaceted force uniquely positioned to shape an organization's trajectory. With a primary focus on recruitment and retention of employees within a company, HR typically takes care of dispute resolutions and labor relations within a company. But modern HR practices demand more. In today‚Äôs business landscape, HR professionals excel in several critical areas:

HR experts identify, clarify, and reinforce the significance of an organization's purpose, values, and culture, fostering a sense of belonging among employees.
HR professionals play a pivotal role in bridging skill gaps. By assessing current competencies and identifying future needs HR designs comprehensive training and development programs for employees to thrive.
By prioritizing well-being, engagement, and satisfaction, HR professionals cultivate a workplace where employees feel valued and motivated to excel.
In a world marked by constant evolution, HR spearheads initiatives that equip organizations to adapt, innovate, and embrace new ways of operating.
As a leader of change, HR professionals embrace new organizational models through strategic planning and seamless execution. This facilitates transitions to more agile and effective structures.
In essence, HR transcends traditional roles, playing a pivotal part in shaping the future of businesses by advocating purpose, bridging skills gaps, enhancing employee experiences, facilitating change, and driving innovation. Their impact on the business landscape is profound, fostering resilient, adaptive, and forward-thinking organizations.

26/10/2024, 14:53 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Dealing with disrespect? Here are three powerful steps to reclaim your dignity and maintain your composure

üí´ Learning to Be Calm When Disrespected: Unlock Your Superpower üí´

In a world where respect is paramount, mastering the art of remaining calm in the face of disrespect is a true superpower.
Here's why:

üíú Inner Peace: Cultivating calmness amidst disrespect keeps you anchored in your own sense of self-worth and inner peace.

üíú Emotional Resilience: Responding calmly demonstrates emotional resilience, showing that you won't let others' actions dictate your emotional state.

üíú Maintaining Control: By staying calm, you maintain control of the situation, preventing it from escalating into unnecessary conflict.

üíú Elevated Presence: Your composed demeanor commands respect, elevating your presence and influence in any situation.

üíúHere are three steps to unlock this superpower:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pause and Breathe: Take a moment to center yourself. Deep breaths allow you to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Empathy: Understand that disrespect often stems from insecurities or misunderstandings. Choose empathy over anger, fostering understanding instead of resentment.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Boundaries Gracefully: Assert your boundaries calmly and confidently. Communicate your expectations respectfully, maintaining your dignity while setting clear limits.

üíú Remember, staying calm when faced with disrespect isn't a sign of weakness‚Äîit's a display of strength, dignity, and self-respect.
üí´Embrace this superpower, and watch as it transforms your interactions, relationships, and ultimately, your life.üí´
26/10/2024, 15:10 - Reshmi: Staying calm at all times.. will always resolve any problems... Another thing to remember is to avoid friendships with staff members... this will help us treat everyone equally at all times
26/10/2024, 15:31 - Vandana: HR can only have one of the two - employees or friends. If you have employees, you will be a successful HR but a lousy friend. If you are a successful friend, you will definitely be a weak HR. Choose wisely.
26/10/2024, 15:33 - Vandana: One less popular LAW of HR Internationally followed. All HR staff - assistants , officers , coordinators or administrators or even managers - are NOT suppose to ACCEPT any gift from anyone. It comes under bribing. So be careful.
26/10/2024, 15:49 - HR British: This was the most valuable lesson I've learned in my career
26/10/2024, 16:06 - Vandana: Thank you

25/11/2024, 15:47 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Check in time is already available in the system
25/11/2024, 20:26 - Vandana: Good evening Team

I've definitely felt that today inspite of making it clear & giving reminders + personal queries resolving, the payroll files were not sent across even from one of you.
It's disappointing. 
If we need to make our systems better, get salaries disbursement earlier, then we need to cur off by 25th of every month & without trials, no ESS or ERP team can do anything. 

This was a trial for a BIG step that we can take in the coming months.

If there's any issue, we can resolve in these trial stage. But I'm noticing a lack of seriousness regarding this.

Hope this effort comes to a better result. 

Good night 
Regards

10/12/2024, 08:10 - Vandana: sending on your whatsapp
10/12/2024, 08:10 - HR British: thanks dear
10/12/2024, 08:32 - Aysha Rasbin: @971506244312 24hrs timelimit for misspunch request is less, atleast 2 working days. Sometimes we face technical issue in syncing biometric attendance to orison. so 1 day gap will be better.
10/12/2024, 08:33 - Vandana: but if you follow a channel, i think it should be sufficient
10/12/2024, 08:33 - Reshmi: yes..we can keep a timeline upto the week
10/12/2024, 08:33 - Vandana: It involves SLTs ?
10/12/2024, 08:34 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Yes when we start implementing we should giv 2 days minumum. 24hrs we can giv only when the system is in placed
10/12/2024, 08:36 - Vandana: For smaller strength, it can be 24 hrs like Dewvale & Hampton. For larger strenths, 48 hrs
10/12/2024, 08:39 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: It is not about smaller strength or larger strength it is about how efficiently system works. Wat ever they hav promised itself not happening properly. So slowly only we can restrict these things. Let us implement the system first and let HR start using it efficiently . Then we will   restrict these areas . This is my opinion
10/12/2024, 08:41 - Vandana: But if we keep the window open for long, the no. of requests will be more
10/12/2024, 08:42 - Vandana: If it can be made aware that we have more time to apply, staff taking it easy n applying late. And subsequently the clearing of backlog never ends
10/12/2024, 08:42 - Vandana: That's why
10/12/2024, 08:42 - Vandana: My opinion
10/12/2024, 08:43 - Reenu Personal: If that is the case
What we will do with the mispunch in attendance in payroll
10/12/2024, 08:43 - Vandana: Officers, please add your suggestions which work best also....
Only I & Poornima are seeing it from our angles. But you have to get the best out of it. So please comment. It's an open floor
10/12/2024, 08:44 - Reenu Personal: At least we should give them some time to get familiarize with system
10/12/2024, 08:50 - HR British: I agree with that, Let's make it a little larger for one month at lease, then we can tighten it.
11/12/2024, 08:37 - Reshmi: Pls share admin evaluation forms

Just a couple of days away from your breaks. Have a restful break. 

A short reminder on Dec Payroll. Since most of you are on holiday from 24th,  please assign yourself a date for submission-

23rd Dec
30th Dec

This will help us meet the necessary timelimit & avoid interaction during your much needed break. 

You can send your preferred date here.

Enjoy your time off. ‚úåüèªüí´ü´Ç

How come leaves updates are taking so long. Till 23rd all HRs were onduty. Holidays not many leaves from 18th onwards. Then why the delay I can't figure it out. 
I really expected Dec Payroll to be a smooth one. Is anyone facing a difficulty  here ?

Please inform the staff to send email or WhatsApp communication themselves. No other family members or friends or guardians on their behalf are supposed to send any emails to HR. If you notice that any email has landed in your inbox, which is not from the staff, then politely reply, informing the professional email ethics to the sender. 
Refrain from getting unnecessarily involved in such cases. 

It's a big üö© red flag to identify & keep yourselves away from such negative situations.

24/01/2025, 05:56 - Aysha Rasbin: Good Morning!
It would be good if the trainings are arranged in the corporate campus. From dubai, no direct transport to British school. They had to arrange two, first to hamidiya & then from there to British.
24/01/2025, 05:59 - Vandana: My concerns were slightly different, but no worries.

25/01/2025, 18:14 - HR British: Done
26/01/2025, 09:44 - Vandana: Dear Team 

This is a gentle reminder to please ensure that all necessary information and approvals are completed in a timely manner to meet the upcoming payroll deadline - 31st January 2025.

As per all our previous ministry complaints, payment was the only issue in the highlight. Our Brand image definitely depends on this aspect too, as to what kind of pay masters we are.

Our salaries may be different from our competitors, but our timely release makes a difference too. I request each one of you to take this as urgent and submit error free files from now on.

üéØ 3-4 days
üéØ Complete focus
üéØ Right approach 

I'm sure we'll do this üí™üèº

Thanks & regards,

08/02/2025, 13:32 - Reshmi: Sent
08/02/2025, 13:38 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Training cost : 6000 is the total amount for 10 months. That means per month it will be 600. So for ex if they spend 3 months then we shd deduct 3*600 as training cost
08/02/2025, 13:40 - Hampton HR: Thank you Reshmi for the swift response , furthermore i would like to know if you have the same for Support staff

10/02/2025, 10:01 - Vandana: This needs to be looked into & only then we must add training cost recovery. 

@971564118122 
Please discuss with PRO to have clarity
10/02/2025, 10:07 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: As this matter falls under your purview, I request you to provide a feasible solution regarding the contract terms. We are currently facing challenges in convincing staff during their exit process.

Please coordinate with the PRO and explore a recovery clause that is in compliance with the Ministry of Labour (MOL) regulations. It is important to ensure that any clause we implement is legally approved and enforceable.
10/02/2025, 10:11 - Vandana: I thought this was for all. Is this for support staff only ? I'm little confused.

25/02/2025, 08:49 - Aysha Rasbin: Good Morning!
Last time we discussed regarding payroll submission date to be the 1st of every month. The last working day leaves won't be approved by SLT/principal on the same day. Sick leave if any also needs 1 day time. Otherwise will not be able to stop manual entries. 
Appreciate other HRs suggestion also
25/02/2025, 08:56 - Reenu Personal: Same here
Now we are manually updating leave on last working day
Its again manual entries
25/02/2025, 08:57 - Reshmi: 2 working days is required for HR's to complete the payroll..I would suggest this..
25/02/2025, 08:57 - Reshmi: submission on last day..is stressful and chances of errors are more
25/02/2025, 09:00 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Plz plan 28 _ 28 payroll cycle so u will get 3 days to complete .
25/02/2025, 09:02 - Vandana: Have discussed this....but the system has to be updated & mapped for each school
25/02/2025, 09:10 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: If u can confirm this then mapping we can do easily in the ERP.
25/02/2025, 09:11 - Vandana: the report is not coming with dates
25/02/2025, 09:11 - Vandana: its not fully functional
25/02/2025, 09:51 - Vandana: Please check the Google sheets for Work Permit/ Visa updates. Change the status in ERP accordingly.
25/02/2025, 09:52 - Hampton HR: Done

25/02/2025, 15:33 - Reshmi: kind reminder
26/02/2025, 08:17 - Reshmi: üí° ‚≠ê 2025 Labor law updates in the UAE ‚≠ê üí° 

The UAE has introduced significant labor law changes effective in 2025, aiming to enhance workplace fairness and adaptability.

Key changes include:

üí´ Extended Work Permits and Golden Visas
 Work Permits: Validity extended from 2 to 3 years for private-sector employees and domestic workers.
Golden Visas: Eligibility expanded to skilled professionals in healthcare, AI, and advanced technology sectors, with the salary threshold reduced to AED 30,000 per month. 

üí´ Minimum Wage and Salary Reforms
Minimum Wage: Employees in skilled categories 1 and 2 must receive at least AED 5,000 monthly, applicable to all new labor contracts issued in 2025.
Wage Protection: Employers are required to pay salaries within 7 days of the due date; delays beyond 30 days may result in a freeze on new work permits. 

üí´ Enhanced Employee Benefits
End-of-Service Savings Scheme: A voluntary program allowing private-sector employees to invest gratuity benefits in low-risk funds, with options for early withdrawal.
Pension for Emiratis: Mandatory registration for pension contributions within one month of hiring, with employer contributions increased from 12.5% to 15%. 

üí´ Strengthened Employee Rights
Remote Work: Employees in digital, IT, and customer support roles can request partial remote work arrangements; employers must provide written reasons for any refusals.
Protection Against Unfair Dismissals: Unjust termination without legal cause now requires compensation of three months' salary, with a fast-track dispute resolution system available through the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation. 

These changes reflect the UAE's commitment to fostering a dynamic and equitable labor market. Businesses and professionals are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these changes to ensure compliance and to capitalize on the new opportunities they present.

08/03/2025, 08:07 - HR British: Dear HR team,
Here are the inspection highlights. I hope I haven't missed any important points
08/03/2025, 08:08 - HR British: MOL Inspection:
1.	Cross-checked the MOL list with the Attendance report (verified each name).
2.	Reviewed staff files, selecting 5 randomly for inspection.
3.	Inspected the cancellation file.
4.	Examined the exit clearance form for the terminated employee.
5.	Inquired about the gratuity calculation process and reviewed one F&F Settlement copy.
6.	Asked why some resigned staff members are still listed in the MOL and have not been canceled yet.
7.	Requested the fines file (each school must maintain a record of any fines imposed on staff members or the school).
8.	Requested the sexual harassment file (each school must maintain a file documenting any sexual harassment incidents; I signed a commitment letter confirming we will keep that file).
MOE Inspection:
1.	Conducted an inspection of all areas of the school, both internal and external, and noted that a room for the maintenance team and drivers containing beds for sleeping is illegal.
2.	Compared the school's blueprints with the actual building and observed that some rooms were modified without official approval.
3.	Noted that some teachers lack teaching licenses and others do not have MOE approvals.
4.	Inquired about the attendance report generated from the biometric system and requested the name of the biometric system used.

10/04/2025, 08:29 - Aysha Rasbin: Currently, the academic staff induction is under process to be digitalized. Staff clicks through PDF or video tutorials, then take a short assessment at the end. Once they submit it, they get a digital CPD certificate.

I think we could do similar for the HR induction ppt/training modules/guidelines like TLS, ILOE etc. We could put all the key information as links in one PDF. At the end, there could be a few questions to check understanding. Once completed, staff would receive a digital training acknowledgment certificate with staff name (a digital copy of the one provided by Ms. Poornima). This would make the process easier, add to evidence and help keep track of who has completed the training.

24/04/2025, 12:55 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Dear All,

Please take note of the following important points and ensure immediate action:

ERP Allowance Updates
All previous position allowance details must be removed from the ERP system. New allowance details must be entered for the newly assigned staff. I will be cross-verifying the payroll against the coordinator allowances, and any mismatches‚Äîespecially Un updated increments from last year‚Äîwill be your responsibility. Please ensure accuracy in this process to avoid any discrepancies.

Exit Employees in WhatsApp Groups
It has come to my attention that several exited employees are still part of school WhatsApp groups. This poses a risk, as internal communications may reach external individuals. Make sure to remove all exited employees from official WhatsApp groups on the same day of their exit without fail.

Let‚Äôs stay vigilant and maintain professionalism in both system updates and communication practices.

01/05/2025, 10:26 - Reshmi: I have a request that we try to complete increments by March, and mails sent as well ...at least from next year...
01/05/2025, 10:38 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: It has been quite challenging for us too to finalize four increment sheets across all schools with complete fairness and consistency. From the Dubai campus alone, we received almost three revision requests.

It was not an easy task to submit the payroll early, especially with all the major changes and revisions in the system. Your ability to manage everything so efficiently under pressure is truly commendable.                                                                                                

Thank you once again for your dedication and hard work. I‚Äôm proud to have such a committed team ‚Äî you all are amazing ü§©ü§©ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è

06/05/2025, 09:55 - Hr Woodlem Poornima: Dear All,

As we begin the new academic year in our CBSE schools, it is essential to organize an ice-breaking session to help new joiners interact and bond with existing staff members. 

Kindly plan and implement a monthly Wellness Day, ensuring it includes activities that promote well-being and encourage interaction among all staff. Please ensure that each session creates a welcoming environment for new employees and helps them integrate smoothly with the team.

Looking forward to your active involvement and timely execution.
