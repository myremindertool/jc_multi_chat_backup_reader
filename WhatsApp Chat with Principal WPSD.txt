22/01/2024, 20:53 - Principal WPSD: Reshmi, when sending candidates for demo to HOD or HoS,  do not share their application or form. It creates a bias...

15/02/2024, 05:30 - Reshmi: Goodmorning mam
15/02/2024, 05:31 - Reshmi: Need ur help in finalising the interview process..as how it should take place after the initial screening is done from HR
15/02/2024, 05:38 - Reshmi: Few concerns 
1. Should SLT take an interview round or only demo round
2. I've asked candidates to limit demo to 15..max 20 minutes. However the demo time often exceeds 40- 45mins
3. Should Principal/Vice-principal meet candidates even if its not recommended by SLT
4. Expectations from candidates with experience from home country
5. Once the demo is completed SLT takes too much time to send their observations down to me..hence the rejected candidates waits for more than an hour to hear the result 
6. Also should we take video recordings for demo
7. Lastly who all are eligible to take the demo

01/03/2024, 11:56 - Reshmi: Staff Name- Alka Ashok KumarDOJ-28th Mar, 2021Current Salary- Aed 4987.5/Below are the few concerns which can help us retain Ms. Alka
1. Can we give 500 Aed as Child allowance as cash, in addition to her increment, after adding her rating for performance.( Fees for Ajman School-12000/-; after the 50 % discount, the staff will have to pay 6000/ & Aed 500/- per month)2. If we are not considering this at the moment, we might have to compromise on new staff with least experience and give additional training for the same.Hence I kindly request you to look into this and give me a favorable reply at the earliest.
01/03/2024, 12:00 - Reshmi: also kindly give access to view Amani file
01/03/2024, 19:30 - Principal WPSD: Staff Name- Alka Ashok KumarDOJ-28th Mar, 2021Current Salary- Aed 4987.5/will leave as her current salary is not enough to support the childs fees in Ajman where only 50% concession is given. 
A salary hike is not an option as we cannot break the salary band. 
Hiring a new staff of sane caliber is expensive: new joinees with no experience will cone for less but need extensive training for DSIB. With Math rated weak, it is not an option. 
Principal suggests that we give her increment as per her rating, but give an child's education allowance calculated at 50% . 
The allowance will cease once child passes XII. This will help us retain her, without causing a ruffle staff at Jurf. This is the best way we can retain her...without spending more on new staff
01/03/2024, 20:14 - Reshmi: OK mam
02/03/2024, 10:33 - Reshmi: kindly give me access to Ms. Amani file
02/03/2024, 11:47 - Principal WPSD: You need to send access request- that option is not popping up for me. Chk if the new forward opens.
02/03/2024, 12:37 - Principal WPSD: Hi Reshmi..
02/03/2024, 12:38 - Principal WPSD: I saw that my WPS account has been created.. will the salary be credited to my account this month? NBD card will be issued only after the salary comes into my account either from WPS or from school account.
02/03/2024, 12:49 - Principal WPSD: Reshmi. Prepare this for all staff when sharing salaries for all staff 24-25

We have been working on allocations and restructuring the organization of the school Teams based on the changing needs of the school as well as the roles and responsibilities that each position entails.

To avoid this, all non core subject teachers  will be led by  Subject Leaders or Subject Coordinators who report to the Head of Curriculum.

The ICT teachers will report to the Head of ICT-Assessment.

10/05/2024, 19:52 - Principal WPSD: Of course she will have access- teachers will not worry about that ! They will not want others in the school to know their response- like sneha, sheelu  or Rohini.. only we know they have sent their resignation. Teachers were told to talk to us about their leaving as they are unhappy about complaints...
10/05/2024, 19:53 - Reshmi: Mam is it only Jasna who had come to u
10/05/2024, 19:53 - Reshmi: Rasha had talked to me

10/05/2024, 21:06 - Principal WPSD: Yes- you mean Mr Hameed? 
He has been a VP and handed only secondary and senior sec. Will not be suitable for 1-4. A female for this age group is preferable.
10/05/2024, 21:09 - Reshmi: this mam
10/05/2024, 21:13 - Principal WPSD: Anita looks like an ideal csndidate to help strengthen teaching- so even if no DSIB experience is there its ok. My only concern is her pushing her products  to parents- if she has an entrepreneurial mindset- she might just be looking to gain some footage in UAE market. Call her.. lets meet to decide...
10/05/2024, 21:15 - Reshmi: Fauzia at 8.30 & Anita at 9
10/05/2024, 21:15 - Reshmi: Gmeet mam

10/05/2024, 21:23 - Reshmi: i called her
10/05/2024, 21:42 - Principal WPSD: So we are left onky with one we interviewd today🫤
10/05/2024, 21:43 - Principal WPSD: U remember - there was one from Amity for KG - and i found her more suitable for primary. I can't remember her name. Chk if she's available...
10/05/2024, 21:45 - Principal WPSD: Have you begun visa process for vivek and ramzan or there is time?
10/05/2024, 22:01 - Reshmi: Ramjan in the coming week
10/05/2024, 22:01 - Reshmi: Vivek has time
10/05/2024, 22:01 - Reshmi: Hope vivek is fine
10/05/2024, 22:01 - Reshmi: But sadly our labor is blocked
10/05/2024, 22:02 - Reshmi: Hence all work is on hold mam
10/05/2024, 22:03 - Reshmi: Sent her a msg now
10/05/2024, 22:16 - Principal WPSD: Vivek is having trouble settling on with the team. I have had several meetings with him and with the PE team& art team. Ppl  are sidelining him and spreading rumours about him- which might impact work culture. I have spoken to Arti and Hajra for monitoring myself and I have visited his class.
There are no issues with his classes as such but other teachers  are targetting him- vicious because his salary is more🫤

11/05/2024, 12:28 - Principal WPSD: Feedback on Anila is not too positive. I was considering her for primary ( sangeeta's place), as during the interview I found her lacking in the warmth one expects from KG practitioners.
11/05/2024, 12:29 - Principal WPSD: Look for others pls... we need to fill this position quickly - with assessment &  LO  starting Namrata and Dhanalatha will not be able to manage for long and their work will be compromised.

02/07/2024, 18:01 - Principal WPSD: Sheryl maintains responsibility for her classroom discipline. However, I have seen her arriving late for her classes. Her lessons are traditional methods this I have observed only during my walks and lack of interactivity. 
She was not scheduled for observations as she was leaving the school.
Regarding collaboration, she has changed the Grade 3 PT1 question paper 9 times without consulting her co-teachers, resulting in challenges for them in preparing students for examinations.
02/07/2024, 18:03 - Principal WPSD: This is from Dhanalatha.  I could give her the benefit of doubt as she was leaving the job...

02/07/2024, 18:13 - Principal WPSD: We could consider taking her in in the absence of any one better or soneone entirely new to DSIB. She will definitely be better - as since she's wanting to come back- it shows her willingness to go through the grind.

I hope this message finds you well. It is with regret that I am writing to inform you that, after careful evaluation , the decision has been made to change  your current designation from English Teacher To English Float Teacher with us effective 19th August 2024. Despite our efforts to provide support and guidance, it is evident that the required improvements have not been realized, and the performance standards expected in your role have not been met.

Please note that  your salary will be reduced to Aed 2500/- effective August, 2024. 

We understand that the above may be difficult to receive, and we are committed to supporting you during this transition. If you have any immediate questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly

15/07/2024, 10:30 - Principal WPSD: Dear Mam, This is Ms Shelly from KG-1 I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a personal situation that has recently arisen. A few days ago, my husband suffered a heart attack, which has placed our family under considerable emotional and financial strain.

 As a result of this unexpected event, i am  facing financial difficulties, particularly with managing our immediate expenses. i would like to  bring to your notice as i ' m new joinee  i even didn't get my vacation salary. In light of these circumstances, I am reaching out to inquire whether the school has any provisions or assistance programs in place to support families during times of crisis.  

I am more than willing to provide any necessary documentation or information to expedite the process. Your understanding and prompt attention to this issue would be deeply appreciated.                                                                                               Thank you very much for your understanding and assistance.                                 Sincerely,

Ms. Shelly Shamoon
Kindergarten Teacher

28/09/2024, 10:38 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
28/09/2024, 10:39 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
28/09/2024, 20:41 - Principal WPSD: Pls do it.
28/09/2024, 20:42 - Principal WPSD: The management decision is final. And put it on record for us to know this- it helps in making future decisions
28/09/2024, 20:42 - Reshmi: Wht is this about mam
28/09/2024, 20:43 - Principal WPSD: Wanted to chk about Nimra ...
28/09/2024, 20:43 - Principal WPSD: Abt Samihas payment... since it's  past- if Betsy has approved and so has the management- go ahead
28/09/2024, 20:44 - Principal WPSD: I had asked Nimra to show proof of transfer to you
28/09/2024, 20:44 - Reshmi: They wanted ur approval as well...that's y
28/09/2024, 20:44 - Reshmi: I'll write as well
28/09/2024, 20:47 - Principal WPSD: Will chk and get back..
29/09/2024, 00:33 - Principal WPSD: Is there any written permission about WFH?  I mean from Betsy? I have msged betsy also to find out.   Also is this part of her FFS? Did she apply for maternity and then didn't return? Or did she resign ?
29/09/2024, 04:14 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
29/09/2024, 06:06 - Principal WPSD: She is actually taking advantage by saying if you don't pay, I will not cancel. Because if she has resigned or we have terminated in Dec abd her LWD was decided as March. Then, it was her duty to hand over by that time. If she did that from home after LWD, then technically, we are not obliged to pay. 
If you had her labour but not approval, and because of that she  was asked to leave and we have proof that she did not submit her papers for approval- then she can not hinder cancellation. 
Are we paying up so that she does not complain? 
Also, for cancellation if labour- do we require her consent?
29/09/2024, 06:12 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
29/09/2024, 06:19 - Principal WPSD: If PRO can cancel, we should cancel immediately without payment.  
Pay minimal amount if we cannot cancel.

30/11/2024, 18:11 - Principal WPSD: She is not an ethical teacher. Lazy- doesn't know how to talk to students- Goes to class without prep- always has excuses when caught. I would not want to recommend. If you need anyone for cover or temporary vacancy, you may-to give her sone time. She must not have got another job- so she's asking.
30/11/2024, 18:12 - Reshmi: I'll pass this msg to Poornima
03/12/2024, 11:19 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
03/12/2024, 11:34 - Principal WPSD: She sent me a msg too.Call up her school to find out why she left- student discipline or staff tension.
If students - then we can think of recommending her to Hampton- salary will be more there. 

She is a good teacher no doubt but we can't take her because: 
 1. Her salary expectation is too high. 2. She has difficulty getting aling with her colleagues.
03/12/2024, 11:48 - Reshmi: Understand mam
03/12/2024, 14:59 - Principal WPSD: <Media omitted>

07/12/2024, 12:09 - Reshmi: in less than 1000 letters
07/12/2024, 12:13 - Reshmi: Ms. Mona Gamal has deleted classroom resources which has led to disruption of students academic progress. This has understandably led to a state of distrust among parents, as they rely on the school’s digital resources to support their child’s education. Ms. Mona Gamals actions has affected the schools reputation and well being
07/12/2024, 12:14 - Reshmi: draft..
07/12/2024, 12:14 - Reshmi: anything to be corrected pls let me know mam
07/12/2024, 17:29 - Principal WPSD: I will draft it and send you. They need the reason for termination... this is what she has done before leaving. So make it more comprehensive. 


Despite repeated counselling- oral and written- Ms. Mona did not fulfil her fundamental duties as Arabic teacher such as going to class on time, planning lessons and correcting notebooks and sending weekly itenerary to her class parents. She disregarded instructions, argued  in departmental meetings and when asked to leave the school, deleted all resources from the Google classroom. This not only disrupted student learning but also created panic and confusion among parents who were anxious about loss of all learning material.
08/12/2024, 19:03 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>
08/12/2024, 20:29 - Principal WPSD: Chk salary expectations- why is she leaving if she's already a supervisor?

23/12/2024, 12:07 - Reshmi: mam..Reda..also if u can help me with drafting
23/12/2024, 12:07 - Reshmi: when ur free
24/12/2024, 08:24 - Principal WPSD: Ms. Reda does not fulfil her fundamental duties as Arabic teacher and needs regular reminders to go to class on time, plan lessons, correct notebooks and sending weekly itenerary to her class parents. She was on multiple occasions, the head of T &L found her repeating the same lesson over weeks and whenever observed- took up lessons already covered. She did not respond to suggestions given, always had excuses. This has hampered learning for students who are not receiving a strong foundation and good work habits as they should in the formative years.
She has shown no improvement even after receiving support from coordinator and subject leaders. She is therefore being asked to leave with the assurance that  her settlement will be as per her contract.

11/01/2025, 10:11 - Reshmi: As we move into the salary revision period, I would like to reiterate that the process will be conducted in a streamlined, fair, and transparent manner. It is important to note that increments are not granted solely based on requests; they follow a well-structured process, whether a staff member asks for it or not.

To ensure clarity and alignment, I encourage each of you to review your job descriptions, roles, responsibilities, and the performance expectations outlined in the Teacher Standards forms that were shared earlier. These will form a key part of the evaluation process.

While the school will consider inflation in line with the Education Cost Index provided by the KHDA, the extent to which teachers have met their job responsibilities will also play a significant role in determining increments. Each teacher can expect an open and fair discussion based on these established criteria, which were shared at the beginning of the academic year.

Please note that the final decision on salary revisions rests with the school management.
11/01/2025, 10:11 - Reshmi: Drafted for staff...just wanted to be sure as its a very important mail

To ensure clarity and alignment, I encourage each of you to review your job descriptions, roles, responsibilities, and the performance expectations outlined in the teacher diary and the Teacher Standards  explicitly described in rubrics   shared with you. These will form a key part of the evaluation process.

21/03/2025, 19:29 - Reshmi: Ok mam
21/03/2025, 21:03 - Principal WPSD: Reshmi, any update on how we plan to proceed with Sneha and Precilla? Sneha has not reported and all of the work has been completed by precilla. 
I will personally look into the orientation and put Arti and Namrata there till the new head and coordinators  come. 
What was the expectation of Manpreet? Since she's a subject coordinator now- she may be willing to join as phase coordinator. Ch on this and we are good to go.

21/03/2025, 22:49 - Principal WPSD: Which position did she apply for? 


I just spoke to him - his parents are coming tomorrow. So I have scheduled my meeting with him on Monday afternoon. You asked Poornima if she can call the candidates on Monday afternoon to finish the selection. Because Tuesday is orientation..we will have no leadership in KG...
Sanober is out now. So we have no choice but to make do with manpreet i  kg and R... to 1&2 ..
21/03/2025, 22:52 - Principal WPSD: I am ok if he takes my meeting time to meet them. 

If we take Manpreet- we will need some coordinator. She herself admitted she has no knowledge of the curriculum and assessment in KG. She has no experience in leadership. She has just been a subject coordinator for EVS in one level if KG.

26/03/2025, 05:18 - Principal WPSD: Whoever has filled the orison can share it with teachers. 

Only for inspection- to share as evidence we had changed acceptable with good features to good. But such changes were not yo be shared with teachers - it was only for us. 
So I am not sure how Sneha managed this.
26/03/2025, 05:19 - Principal WPSD: Because these teachers for inspection would eventually give good lessons with coplanning.
26/03/2025, 05:23 - Reshmi: We need to chk this mam

28/03/2025, 11:42 - Reshmi: Hello Ma'am, 
I hope you are doing well. I’m truly sorry to inform you that I won’t be able to join Woodlem Park School due to some urgent financial constraints at home. Unfortunately, I was serving only a one-month notice at my current school, which meant losing almost two months' salary. Initially, I was prepared to bear this loss, but given the unexpected financial uncertainties, I am now in a very difficult situation, where I am not in position to lose this money. 
I explored every possible alternative but couldn't find a viable solution. However, please rest assured that my wife, Jagpreet, who has been hired for KG, will continue with Woodlem Park. I sincerely appreciate your understanding and would love the opportunity to work with you in the future once my financial situation stabilizes. Thank you for your support and kindness.

03/05/2025, 21:26 - Principal WPSD: Dear Staff 

While I understand that you may not be fully pleased with your new package, the decision of the management is final in this regard. The salary review process has been done meticulously over months to ensure parity within the bands- while considering market trends, Cost of education index, your own service and experience along with performance. Wherever there has been great disparity we have ensured to bridge these gaps. 
May I also remind you that you all are under the confidentiality clause, disclosing or discussing packages with your colleagues is a breach of this non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.  Besides it only leads to unpleasantness and impacts negatively on the work culture. I urge you to refrain from this.
03/05/2025, 21:27 - Principal WPSD: You can send this mail to all staff
04/05/2025, 06:39 - Reshmi: <Media omitted>

Prepare a list of those whose salaries are a concern- not because they feel so but because we also feel they need to be considered- such as Islamic, Arabic teachers, aiman, gayatri and others.. 

Write their current salaries- the band - and average salaries in respective dept. 
Give this yo me by 4.pm on Monday. I have a meeting with GM Tues morning. Will personally take these up.

05/05/2025, 08:42 - Reshmi: Dear All,

 I understand that some of you may feel disappointed with the outcomes of the recent compensation review. Please know that the management has taken great care over several months to review salaries fairly and responsibly, considering market trends, the cost of education index, individual service, experience, and performance. Where there were significant gaps, we have made efforts to address and correct them to ensure greater fairness across teams.

I would also like to  remind everyone that we are all bound by a confidentiality agreement regarding compensation. Discussing salary details with colleagues not only breaches this agreement but can also unintentionally create misunderstandings or tension, which can harm the positive and collaborative environment we value so much. I trust that you will continue to uphold the spirit of professionalism and teamwork as we move forward together.
